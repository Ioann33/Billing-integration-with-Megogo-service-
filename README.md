My second commercial project. I was fully responsible for billing integration with Megogo video service. I developed Backend and Frontend. Planned to connect in the future another TV services (didn't get this one), therefore I made a flexible connection, implemented DigitalTV interface to service class, and called method in DigitalTvController. This system assures an easy connection to similar TV services and includes a differentiated payment system and an advanced system of error-catching. As usual, your favorite Laravel + vue ))
